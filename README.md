# python-occ-demos

Wanted to try out this library for editing and converting CAD files.  I know very little about CAD!  But [someone on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14519057/1609514) mentioned this library...

I installed it from here:
 - https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pythonocc-core

It was a bit of a pain. Had to install a few other bits and bobs (e.g. Qt5) and then it still didn't work.  Had to uninstall and reinstall and then it worked.

The only documentation I could find is here and it's quite limited (parts are out of date):
 - https://pythonocc-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

However there are lots of example scripts and notebooks which seem to be up to date.

I wanted to try out the exporting of models to files. [STEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21)(.stp), [X3D](.x3d) and [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) (.stl) seem to work, but STEP seems to be the most widely used.

However, I didn't find it very user-friendly. Might try [FreeCAD](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/freecad) next.
